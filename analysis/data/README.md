## Overview
Data and R script used for the manuscript: Nest shape does not affect ant colony performance against a nest invader despite altered worker movement and communication

***

## Purpose of the study
### Investigating how nest shape influences how _Temnothorax rugatulus_ colonies perform essential tasks, specifically nest defense. This includes colony performance against a conspecific nest invader, communication through worker interaction networks, and movement and traffic jams through the nest.
